4: Introduction: My contribution
    - explain the title: I worked on making generative for tabular and relational data models more flexible and more expressive, in particular.
    1: Method for training-free conditioning, according to logical constraints
    2: Method for generating relation data without with maximal expressivity (no independence assumptions)
    3: Generate tabular data with tractable models

5: Training-free conditioning of ....
    - Problem: Generative models cannot be conditioned on logical constraints without specific training for any constraint.
    - We propose a method for enforcing user defined logical constraints on pre-trained score-based diffusion models.
    We prove we achieve sota results for approximating condtional distributions when applied to tabular data.
